# basic_web_portal

A basic website using Python3 and sqlite with no external packages.

## ❗ Warning

This is just an excersize for educational purposes, and in no way meant to be used in a production setting without serious rework for modern cyber security considerations. Please read the [License](#license) before use.

## Usage

After cloning the repo, run `main.py` with python. The exact command depends on your operating system and development settings.

``` python3 main.py ```

You may need to adjust `config.ini` for it to work, i.e. use a different port if 8000 is already in use.
